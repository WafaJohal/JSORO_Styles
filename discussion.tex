\subsection{Parents Interviews}
We interviewed parents after each session to gather their impression on the interaction. We asked to observe and listen to the interaction.

Many parents noticed the style differences, refering to the authoritative robot as "expressive or "severe" and to the permissve as "shy". 
A few children noticed the robot's behavioural differences ("severe", "nice")
Some children also noticed behavioural differences between the robots, severe nice 
Auto robot is sec 

About authority, children were doing what the robot was saying, but robots needs to vary its expressibility in order to be credible and since entertaining


Roles for future (game with difficult rules etc)
Parents say it cold be a help to make homework more ludique

Playing with the child good for social bounding, parents like the fact that event if it is a root for homework it can be un also nd create bounding

Important that the robot learns from the child (to create link for instance)

Polyrole (just like parents is better, one robot for all, otherwise peut en prendre un en grippe)

Authoritarian has more severe voice

Styles can be a good way to introduce variability
