	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between individual differences and proxemic behaviour in an HRI set- ting involving a robot approaching a person. In total 33 par- ticipants took part in three different scenarios; verbal interac- tion, physical interaction and no interaction. Participant con- trol over the robot, and approach direction was also varied. Measurements of the preferred robot approach distance was obtained, and analysed along with the participants' demo- graphic and personality data. The results indicate differences in approach direction preferences based on gender. Also, re- sults show that the participants' personality traits of extraver- sion and conscientiousness are associated with changes in ap- proach distance preferences according to robot autonomy. The results are discussed in light of relevant literature from the social sciences.},

Twenty- eight participants interacted with a robot in two experimental conditions in which the robot’s behaviour was varied. Reliability analysis and a PCA was performed on the NARS items, creating three new subscales. Correlations between the subscales and other evaluations of the robot's behaviour found meaningful results, supporting the use of the NARS in English speaking samples.},

	abstract = {To emote literally means to move or prepare for action. A large body of research indicates that flexor and extensor movements are conditionally associated with approach- and avoidance-related motivations. It has also been widely argued that approach and avoidant motivations are asymmetrically instantiated in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Nevertheless, to date, these literatures remain largely separate. In the present investigation, flexor and extensor movements that were visuospatially contextualized as being directed toward the self and away from the self were observed to be asymmetrically represented in the approach and avoidance hemispheres. Moreover, this pattern of hemispheric specialization was manifested to a greater degree the higher participants' self-reported level of daily positive affect and the lower their self-reported level of dispositional anxiety. Collectively, these findings have direct implications for models of embodied emotional and perceptual processing, as well as for investigations of individual differences in emotional disposition.},
